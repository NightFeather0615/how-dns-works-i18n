# Episodes
ep1:
  7: "暫停！"
  8: "電腦和其他設備使用 IP 地址交流以識別對方的身分。"
  9: "但是人們很難記住 IP 地址，所以他們使用單字。"
  10: "網域名稱系統（DNS）將兩者連結在一起並帶你抵達目的地。"
  11: "這就是 DNS 的運作原理"
  12: "等等！什麼？有新的請求給我嗎？這傢伙除了整天上網就無事可做了。"
  13-1: "在我打擾作業系統之前，先讓我看看我知不知道 dnsimple.com"
  13-2: "唉…… 空空如也"
  14: "嘿作業系統！你在嗎？我需要你幫個小忙。你知道哪裡可以找到 dnsimple.com 嗎？"
  15-1: "TOO_BUSY_ERR"
  15-2: "正在備份"
  16: "拜……拜……拜託？可以看一下嗎？"
  17: "正在確認……"
  18-1: "沒有。我不知道它在哪裡……"
  18-2: "……但我知道該問誰……"
  19: "解析器！"
  20: "瀏覽器和作業系統會先在快取中確認它們是否知道 dnsimple.com 的 IP 地址。如果都不知道，作業系統會調用解析器。"
  21-1: "那個神祕的解析器是誰？他會怎麼做？"
  21-2: "在下一集《DNS 的運作原理》中尋找答案。"

ep2:
  9: "對我的新請求？太 棒 了！"
  10: "dnsimple.com？沒問題！"
  11: "先確認一下我的快取……"
  12-1: "不在那裡！"
  12-2: "我該怎麼找到那個網站？"
  13: "讓我問問根伺服器！"
  14-1: "The resolver server is usually your ISP (Internet Service Provider). All resolvers must know one thing: where to locate the root server."
  14-2: "Resolver"
  15: "The root server knows where to locate the .COM TLD server. TLD stands for Top-Level Domain."
  16-1: "Ladies and gentleman, welcome to flight R0XX to the root server. The weather is..."
  16-2: "Not my kind of road trip!"
  17: "A few milliseconds later..."
  18-1: "Thank you for flying with us. We hope to welcome you on board again."
  18-2: "Finally!"
  19: "Oh boy! I hope root is here!"
  21: "Who's there? What do you seek?"
  22-1: "Will the resolver find his way to dnsimple.com?"
  22-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

ep3:
  4: "NEXT!"
  5: "NNNEEEEXXXXT!!!"
  6: "What can I help you with?"
  7: "Root, I am trying to locate the IP address for the website dnsimple.com..."
  8: "Do you know where I can find it?"
  9: "Sorry resolver. I don't know where to find dnsimple.com."
  10: "But I can tell you where to find the .COM Top-level domain server!"
  11: ""
  12: "But first, I'll store this information, so I don't have to ask the root again."
  13: "This root server is just one of the 13 root name servers that exist today."
  14: "Root servers sit at the top of the DNS hierarchy."
  15: "They are scattered around the globe and operated by 12 independent organisations."
  16: "They are named [letter].root-servers.net where [letter] ranges from A to M."
  17: "This doesn't mean that we have only 13 physical servers to support the whole internet!"
  18: "Each organisation provides multiple physical servers distributed around the globe."
  23-1: "Not my kind of road trip"
  23-2: "But we are now here..."
  24-1: "How will the .COM TLD server help our friend the resolver?"
  24-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

ep4:
  3: "Well, it's much more comfortable than I imagined..."
  4: "...What do you do when they recommend 'room temperature' for certain drinks?"
  6: "Sorry! I am looking for dnsimple.com, do you know where I can find it?"
  7: "Now, that's a great question!"
  8: "The coordination of most top-level domains (TLDs) belong to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)"
  9-1: "The .COM TLD was one of the first created in 1985."
  9-2: "And today, it is the largest TLD on the internet."
  10-1: "Other type of TLDs include:"
  10-2: "1. Country code TLDs. Usually, their 2 letter ISO code."
  11: "2. Internationalized country code TLDs."
  12-1: "3. Generic TLDs: .NET, .ORG, .EDU, etc..."
  12-2: "Usually, TLDs with 3 or more letters."
  13-1: "4. Infrastructure TLDs: .ARPA, mostly used for reverse DNS lookups."
  13-2: "The opposite of what we are doing now."
  13-3: "We are doing this:"
  13-4: "Reverse DNS does this:"
  14: "And today, many new generic TLDs are being created!"
  15: "Now, back to your question resolver!"
  16: "I am afraid I don't know the IP address for dnsimple.com"
  17: "But I have found the name servers!"
  18: "Great! I'll store that information for later"
  20: "The .COM found the authoritative name servers for the domain dnsimple.com."
  21-1: "But what do these names mean?"
  21-2: "We'll find out very soon..."
  22: "So the journey continues..."
  23-1: "Who are the authoritative name servers?"
  23-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

ep5:
  2: "How could the .COM TLD server point me to the authoritative name servers?"
  3: "How could he make the connection? There are so many .COM domains!"
  4: "Easy! With the help of the Domain Registrar!"
  5: "When a domain is purchased, the domain registrar reserves the name..."
  6: "... and communicates to the TLD registry the authoritative name servers."
  7: "We have arrived!"
  8: "Papers, please!"
  9: "Oh! I'll be quick. I have no intention of staying here. I am looking for ns1.dnsimple.com."
  10: "Papers, please!"
  11: "Oh boy! The only thing I have is a request for dnsimple.com. The .COM TLD told me that ns1.dnsimple.com could tell me where I could locate the IP address."
  12: "Well, in that case..."
  13: "I am ns1.dnsimple.com"
  14: "And I can provide you with that answer!"
  15: "Currently there are 4 of us that know how to resolve any domain managed by dnsimple.com"
  16-1: "We provide answers to DNS queries: Websites, e-mail, ..."
  16-2: "We are the ultimate authority on this stuff."
  17: "No cached values. Not asking someone else. Only the real deal."
  18: "You see, usually there is more than one name server attached to any domain."
  19-1: "You, the resolver, you are given this list in some unknown order."
  19-2: "You might query the first name server in the list."
  19-3: "OR NOT! We have to be ready!"
  20-1: "Because there is more of us, the work load is better distributed."
  20-2: "And the DNS zone availability is increased."
  21: "Especially in case of a failure!"
  22-1: "So if you want to know who are the authoritative name servers for your domain, run a WHOIS query."
  22-2: "There are a few websites that provide this information."
  23: "So here you go: 50.31.213.210"
  24: "What?"
  25-1: "dnsimple.com IP address is: 50.31.213.210"
  25-2: "Anything else?"
  26: "Uh, no. Thanks!"
  27: "I guess I'll save that."
  28: "The resolver finally got the answer he was looking for! Hurray for the Authoritative name server!"
  29: "Time to go home!"
  30-1: "Will the resolver make it back home in time?"
  30-2: "Find out in the next episode of how DNS works."

ep6:
  3: "JETPACKS"
  4: "It was so cool visiting everyone!"
  5: "The root told me where to find the .COM server."
  6: "The TLD server gave me the Authoritative name servers addresses."
  7: "Then, ns1.dnsimple.com gave me the IP for dnsimple.com."
  8: "Finally, here we are, I can now deliver the answer."
  9: "JETPACKS"
  10: "Resolver! It's about time! I have been waiting a few milliseconds now. I thought you were lost!"
  11-1: "Hi OS! I'll tell you about my trip later."
  11-2: "Here is your answer..."
  12: "dnsimple.com IP address:"
  13: "Great! I'll save this so I don't have to bother you again if he asks for dnsimple.com."
  14: "Did someone mention me?"
  15: "Yes! Quick! Ask 50.31.213.210 whatever you need."
  16-1: "Finally! I was considering displaying one of those funny gifs to entertain my audience while you were away."
  16-2: "Oh, well, maybe later."
  17: "Connecting to 50.31.213.210"
  19: "Hi! Could you please send me your HTML content?"
  20: "Sure thing! On the way!"
  21: "Here we go..."
  24-1: "It's getting late."
  24-2: "I'll watch that last video on youtube."
  25: "Youtube? That, I know where to find!"
  26: "Well, we have completed our journey and this story is coming to an end."
  27: "We hope you have enjoyed it!"
  28: "Don't be a stranger! We're on twitter."
  29: "Thank you for reading!"
  31-1: "Is that it? Is this the end for real? No way!"
  31-2: "There is one more Bonus Episode!"
  31-3: "Read Bonus Episode"

ep7:
  1: "Wait..."
  2: "Something is missing here!"
  3: "How could the resolver find 'ns1.dnsimple.com' before 'dnsimple.com'?"
  4: "Since 'ns1.dnsimple.com' is a subdomain of 'dnsimple.com', how could we resolve 'ns1.dnsimple.com' without resolving 'dnsimple.com' first?"
  5: "Isn't the search going backwards?"
  6: "Wouldn't we get stuck in a loop at some point?"
  7: "For example, let's say that the authoritative server for domain.com is ns1.domain.com"
  8-1: "If I wanted to browse domain.com, the .COM TLD would tell me to get the IP address from the authoritative server: ns1.domain.com"
  8-2: "Go ask ns1.domain.com"
  9-1: "ns1.domain.com is a subdomain of domain.com"
  9-2: "We cannot get to a subdomain without getting to the domain first!"
  10: "Stuck in a loop!"
  11: "So, what happened? How come the resolver was able to find 'dnsimple.com' through 'ns1.dnsimple.com'?"
  12-1: "Simple!"
  12-2: "Glue records!"
  13: "Glue records?"
  14: "Exactly!"
  15-1: "Awesome!"
  15-2: "I'll explain then!"
  16: "When the resolver asked the .COM TLD about dnsimple.com, extra information was attached to that response."
  17: "The resolver got at least one IP address for each name server."
  18: "We call that the glue!"
  19: "So the resolver not only got the name of the authoritative name server, it also got the IP address."
  20: "Thus breaking the circular dependency."
  21: "Nice! I understand it now!"
  22: "Glue records rock!"
  23-1: "Yes, they do!"
  23-2: "hahaha, thanks!"
  25: "You made it through the end! Now is a good time to watch the video that we made for this comic!"
  26-1: "Watch this short animation based on this comic. They finally have a voice!"
  26-2: "Watch video"
